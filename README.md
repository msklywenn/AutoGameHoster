# AutoGameHoster

Automatically hosts on your twitch channel the streamer with the biggest number of views on a specified game

# How to start
First, you must set the following environment variables:
 * GAME_ID: the twitch game id you're interested in. (Eg: Pawarumi is 493239, Hearthstone is 138585, etc)
 * CLIENT_ID: ID from an app on the twitch dev dashboard
 * TOKEN: You get it by going to https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?client_secret=<secret>&client_id=<client>&redirect_uri=<oauthredirect>&response_type=token&scope=chat:edit+chat:read+channel_editor. Replace <secret> with the generated app client secret, <client> with the client app ID and <oauthredirect> with whatever URL you want to receive the token to. The token will be in the redirect URL after #access_token=.

Then you just start node on index.js.

So, basically, from a unix shell:
`$ TOKEN=<token> CLIENT_ID=<client id> GAME_ID=<game id> node index.js"
